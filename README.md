**Project Description**

Inclusive Language Checker is a web-based tool that analyzes written text to identify non-inclusive, biased, or insensitive language and suggests inclusive alternatives. It helps improve accessibility and fairness in professional, academic, and general content.

**The Problem Statement**

Many written materials unintentionally include gender bias, ableist terms, or exclusionary language. These issues negatively impact inclusivity, accessibility, and equal representation, especially in job descriptions, documentation, and public communication.

**The Solution**

The project uses AI-powered text analysis to detect non-inclusive language and provide context-aware, inclusive alternatives. Users can review suggestions, replace individual terms, or apply all recommendations at once for cleaner, more inclusive text.
