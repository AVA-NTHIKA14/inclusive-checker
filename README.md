Project Description

Inclusive Language Checker is a web-based tool that analyzes written text to identify non-inclusive, biased, or insensitive language and suggests inclusive alternatives. It helps improve accessibility and fairness in professional, academic, and general content.

The Problem Statement

Many written materials unintentionally include gender bias, ableist terms, or exclusionary language. These issues negatively impact inclusivity, accessibility, and equal representation, especially in job descriptions, documentation, and public communication.

The Solution

The project uses AI-powered text analysis to detect non-inclusive language and provide context-aware, inclusive alternatives. Users can review suggestions, replace individual terms, or apply all recommendations at once for cleaner, more inclusive text.
